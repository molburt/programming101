Files that describe the big ideas of programming.

FULL DISCLOSURE: I am as new to this as you are even if I understand it fairly well. I can try to teach you as best I can but I 
can't promise I'm doing everything 100% correctly. That said, I use a lot of quotes from other websites to explain things so it 
should be pretty sound advice.

On the topic of websites I reference, I mostly pull from w3schools and MDN. I use w3schools for definitions because they explain 
things in such a way that is easier for a complete beginner to understand. If you want to look up actual code, I suggest you use 
MDN. It's just better.

So, I figured the best way to do this was to break everything up into topics. It would probably be best to do them in order and 
not to move on until you have a pretty firm understanding of the previous topics.

I hope this helps! Good luck!
