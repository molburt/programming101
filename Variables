VARIABLES

GOAL: Know what a variable is and how it is used in JavaScript.

"JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values...All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names...
variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like 'John Doe'."

To create a variable, use the var keyword followed by the unique name you wish to give that variable. You may also initialize a 
variable, which is to say, you may assign it a value immediately, by following the declaration with an equal sign and then the 
value.

EXAMPLES:
var x;
var name = 'Molly';
var number = x + y;

PRACICE PROBLEM:
Step 1) Create a variable and name it favoriteColor.
Step 2) Initialize the variable with your favorite color.
Step 3) Display favoriteColor using console.log().
